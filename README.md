This repository established as an online appendix contains the data of our study.

## Description
**raw-data-rq2-classifiers-performance.xlsx** contains whole performance of the four machine learning classifiers in the different configurations.

**D-1-2018** contains all information regarding the nine buckets created according to the study configuration (D-1-18) that excludes answers posted after Jan 1, 2018. Each bucket is composed by two raw files (test.csv, train.csv) and four arff files (test.arff, train.arff, train_balanced.arff, train_balanced_sub.arff).

**test.csv**, **train.csv**, **test.arff**, and **train.arff** contain training and test instances for the corresponding bucket.

**train_balanced.arff** contains train.arff instances plus leveraged artificial instances generated by SMOTE.

**train_balanced_sub.arff** contains train.arff leveraged instances and a subset of non-leverage instances of train.arff.

The other datasets (D-7-2017, D-1-2017, D-7-2016, D-1-2016) are organized in the same format previously described for D-1-2018.
